# ADR-001: Microservices Architecture

## Status

**Accepted** - January 15, 2024

## Context

First Viscount is building a modern e-commerce platform that needs to handle high traffic, support rapid development, and scale independently across different business domains. We need to decide on the overall architectural approach for the platform.

### Requirements

- **Scalability**: Different parts of the system have varying load patterns (catalog browsing vs order processing)
- **Development Velocity**: Multiple teams need to work independently without blocking each other
- **Technology Diversity**: Different domains may benefit from different technologies and data stores
- **Fault Isolation**: Failures in one area shouldn't bring down the entire platform
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Ability to deploy and rollback individual services independently
- **Data Ownership**: Clear boundaries around data access and responsibility

### Constraints

- **Team Size**: Initially 3-4 development teams with 4-6 developers each
- **Operational Complexity**: Limited DevOps resources initially
- **Consistency Requirements**: Strong consistency needed for orders and inventory
- **Performance**: Sub-200ms response times for API calls
- **Budget**: Cost-effective infrastructure utilization

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Monolithic Architecture

**Pros:**
- Simpler deployment and operations
- Easier to maintain consistency
- Lower infrastructure costs initially
- Simpler debugging and testing
- No network latency between components

**Cons:**
- Single point of failure for entire platform
- Difficult to scale individual components
- Technology lock-in across all domains
- Deployment coordination required for all changes
- Database coupling across all features

### 2. Modular Monolith

**Pros:**
- Clear module boundaries within single deployment
- Easier operations than microservices
- Shared database with clear module ownership
- Potential future extraction to microservices

**Cons:**
- Still single deployment artifact
- Limited technology diversity
- Scaling constraints at application level
- Risk of module coupling over time

### 3. Microservices Architecture

**Pros:**
- Independent scaling of services
- Technology diversity per domain
- Independent deployment and development
- Fault isolation between services
- Clear ownership boundaries
- Easier to reason about individual services

**Cons:**
- Increased operational complexity
- Network latency between services
- Data consistency challenges
- More complex testing scenarios
- Higher infrastructure costs

## Decision

We will adopt a **microservices architecture** with the following service boundaries:

### Core Services

1. **Product Catalog Service** (Port 8082)
   - Product information and search
   - Category management
   - Pricing and promotions

2. **Inventory Service** (Port 8083)
   - Stock levels and reservations
   - Warehouse management
   - Stock movements

3. **Order Management Service** (Port 8084)
   - Order lifecycle management
   - Payment processing coordination
   - Order history and tracking

4. **Delivery Service** (Port 8085)
   - Shipping label generation
   - Carrier integration
   - Delivery tracking

5. **Notification Service** (Port 8086)
   - Multi-channel communications
   - Template management
   - Delivery tracking

6. **Platform Coordination Service** (Port 8081)
   - Workflow orchestration
   - Saga pattern implementation
   - Cross-service coordination

### Service Characteristics

- **Database per Service**: Each service owns its data
- **API-First**: REST APIs with OpenAPI specifications
- **Event-Driven**: Asynchronous communication via Apache Kafka
- **Autonomous**: Services can be developed, tested, and deployed independently
- **Domain-Aligned**: Service boundaries follow business domain boundaries

## Rationale

### Why Microservices Over Monolith

1. **Business Domain Alignment**: E-commerce naturally decomposes into distinct domains (catalog, orders, inventory, delivery)

2. **Scaling Requirements**: 
   - Catalog service needs high read throughput
   - Order service needs strong consistency
   - Notification service has burst traffic patterns
   - Each can be scaled independently

3. **Team Structure**: Multiple teams can work independently on different services without coordination overhead

4. **Technology Optimization**:
   - Product catalog can use search-optimized technology
   - Notification service benefits from document databases
   - Inventory service needs strong ACID guarantees

5. **Fault Isolation**: Delivery service outage shouldn't prevent order placement

### Service Boundary Rationale

- **Product Catalog**: High-read, eventual consistency acceptable, search-heavy
- **Inventory**: Strong consistency required, relatively low volume
- **Order Management**: ACID transactions required, medium volume
- **Delivery**: External API integration, variable latency
- **Notification**: High volume, burst patterns, multiple providers
- **Platform Coordination**: Cross-cutting concerns, workflow management

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Independent Scaling**: Each service can scale based on its specific load patterns
- **Technology Diversity**: Teams can choose optimal technology stacks for their domains
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service don't cascade to others
- **Development Velocity**: Teams can develop and deploy independently
- **Clear Ownership**: Unambiguous responsibility for each business domain
- **Future-Proof**: Easy to extract additional services as business grows

### Negative

- **Operational Complexity**: More services to monitor, deploy, and maintain
- **Network Overhead**: Inter-service communication adds latency
- **Data Consistency**: Eventual consistency patterns required across services
- **Testing Complexity**: Integration testing requires multiple service coordination
- **Infrastructure Costs**: Higher overhead than single monolith
- **Distributed System Challenges**: Network partitions, service discovery, circuit breakers needed

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Operational Complexity**:
   - Standardized deployment pipelines
   - Comprehensive monitoring and observability
   - Service mesh for traffic management
   - Infrastructure as Code

2. **Network Overhead**:
   - Service co-location strategies
   - Efficient serialization protocols
   - Caching layers
   - Bulk operations where appropriate

3. **Data Consistency**:
   - Saga pattern for distributed transactions
   - Event sourcing for audit trails
   - Compensating actions for rollback
   - Eventually consistent read models

4. **Testing Complexity**:
   - Contract testing between services
   - Service virtualization for isolated testing
   - Comprehensive end-to-end test suites
   - Chaos engineering practices

## Implementation Guidelines

### Service Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service has one clear business purpose
2. **Autonomous**: Services should minimize dependencies on other services
3. **API Contract**: Well-defined, versioned APIs with backward compatibility
4. **Idempotency**: All operations should be idempotent for reliability
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing

### Data Management

- **Database per Service**: No shared databases between services
- **Event-First**: State changes published as events for loose coupling
- **Saga Pattern**: Distributed transactions using choreography and orchestration
- **CQRS**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation where beneficial

### Communication Patterns

- **Synchronous**: REST APIs for real-time queries
- **Asynchronous**: Apache Kafka for event streaming
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka for dynamic service location
- **Circuit Breakers**: Hystrix patterns for resilience
