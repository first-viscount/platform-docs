# First Viscount Platform Charter

## Project Vision

Build a production-grade e-commerce platform using microservices architecture to gain deep, practical experience with distributed systems patterns while creating a scalable, maintainable system that can handle real-world e-commerce demands.

## Dual Purpose

### 1. Learning Objectives
- Master microservices architecture patterns and anti-patterns
- Experience the real challenges of distributed systems
- Build expertise in event-driven architectures
- Understand service boundaries and data consistency
- Gain hands-on experience with modern DevOps practices

### 2. Business Objectives
- Create a scalable e-commerce platform
- Support 10K+ concurrent users
- Enable independent service deployment
- Achieve 99.9% uptime for critical services
- Sub-second response times for customer-facing APIs

## Core Principles

1. **Build One Service Completely** - Full implementation with tests, monitoring, and CI/CD before moving to the next
2. **Experience the Pain** - Intentionally encounter and solve distributed systems challenges
3. **Production-Grade from Day One** - No shortcuts on quality, security, or operations
4. **Document Real Learnings** - Capture what actually happened, not what theory predicted
5. **Multi-Repo Reality** - Experience the complexity of coordinating changes across repositories

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

- **Database per Service** - No shared databases, period
- **Event-Driven Communication** - Services communicate via events, not direct calls
- **API Versioning** - All APIs versioned from day one
- **Security First** - Authentication and authorization built in, not bolted on
- **Observable by Design** - Monitoring, tracing, and logging from the start

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success
- All services deployable independently
- Zero shared database queries
- Full distributed tracing implemented
- Chaos testing demonstrates resilience
- Performance meets SLA under load

### Learning Success
- Can debug distributed transactions
- Understands eventual consistency trade-offs
- Has implemented compensation patterns
- Can explain service boundary decisions
- Has production-ready monitoring dashboards

## Project Scope

### Initial Services (Phase 1)
1. Platform Coordination Service
2. Product Catalog Service
3. Inventory Management Service
4. Order Management Service

### Future Services (Phase 2)
5. Delivery Management Service
6. Notifications Service

## Technology Decisions

- **Language**: Python with FastAPI
- **Event Streaming**: Redpanda (Kafka-compatible)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (one per service)
- **Service Mesh**: Traefik
- **Container**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose â†’ K3s
- **Authentication**: JWT with OAuth2

## Timeline

- **Weeks 1-4**: Platform Coordination Service (complete)
- **Weeks 5-8**: Product Catalog Service (complete)
- **Weeks 9-12**: Inventory Management Service (complete)
- **Weeks 13-16**: Order Management Service (complete)
- **Weeks 17-20**: Integration, testing, and hardening
- **Weeks 21+**: Additional services and optimization

## Risk Acknowledgment

We acknowledge this approach is 5-10x more complex than a monolith. This complexity is intentional for learning purposes. We will:
- Document every challenge encountered
- Build solutions to real problems, not theoretical ones
- Accept temporary productivity loss for long-term learning gain

## Commitment

This charter represents our commitment to building a real distributed system, experiencing real challenges, and gaining real expertise. We choose the harder path because the learning is in the struggle.
