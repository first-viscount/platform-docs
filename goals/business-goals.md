## Competitive Advantages

Through this architecture, we enable:

1. **Rapid Innovation**: Deploy features independently
2. **Unlimited Scale**: Each service scales based on need
3. **High Reliability**: Failures isolated to single services
4. **Cost Optimization**: Pay for what you use
5. **Team Autonomy**: Services owned by small teams

## Constraints Acknowledged

- Initial complexity higher than monolith
- Operational overhead increased
- Data consistency challenges
- Network latency between services
- Debugging complexity increased

These constraints are accepted as trade-offs for the scalability and flexibility benefits.
