# Learning Goals

## Primary Objective

Gain deep, practical experience with microservices architecture by building a real distributed system and experiencing its challenges firsthand.

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Distributed Transaction Management
**Goal**: Implement and debug distributed transactions across multiple services

**Must Implement**:
- [ ] Saga Pattern for order fulfillment
- [ ] Compensation logic for failed transactions
- [ ] Event sourcing for audit trail
- [ ] Handling partial failures gracefully

**Example Implementation**:
```python
# Order Saga: 
# 1. Reserve inventory (Inventory Service)
# 2. Process payment (Payment Service - future)
# 3. Create order (Order Service)
# 4. Send confirmation (Notification Service - future)
# 
# Each step must be reversible if later steps fail
```

### 2. Service Discovery & Communication
**Goal**: Master service-to-service communication patterns

**Must Implement**:
- [ ] Service registry with health checks
- [ ] Circuit breakers for resilience
- [ ] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Load balancing strategies

**Hands-On Challenges**:
- Kill a service mid-transaction and watch recovery
- Introduce network latency and observe behavior
- Implement bulkhead pattern to prevent cascade failures

### 3. Data Consistency in Distributed Systems
**Goal**: Understand and implement eventual consistency patterns

**Must Experience**:
- [ ] Read-after-write consistency issues
- [ ] Distributed cache invalidation
- [ ] Event ordering challenges
- [ ] Duplicate event handling

**Real Scenarios to Build**:
- Inventory count that's eventually consistent
- Order status that propagates through events
- Product catalog updates with cache invalidation

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture Mastery
**Goal**: Build production-grade event streaming with Redpanda/Kafka patterns

**Must Implement**:
- [ ] Event sourcing for order history
- [ ] CQRS for read/write separation
- [ ] Partition strategies for scalability
- [ ] Consumer group management
- [ ] Exactly-once semantics

**Specific Patterns**:
```python
# Event Types to Implement:
# - OrderCreated
# - InventoryReserved
# - InventoryReleased
# - ProductUpdated
# - OrderShipped
```

### 5. Observability & Debugging
**Goal**: Build skills to debug distributed systems effectively

**Must Implement**:
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Correlation IDs across services
- [ ] Structured logging with context
- [ ] Custom metrics and dashboards
- [ ] Trace sampling strategies

**Debugging Scenarios**:
- Find why an order is stuck
- Track down missing inventory updates
- Identify performance bottlenecks across services

### 6. API Evolution & Compatibility
**Goal**: Master backward/forward compatibility in distributed systems

**Must Handle**:
- [ ] API versioning strategies
- [ ] Schema evolution in events
- [ ] Rolling deployments without downtime
- [ ] Feature flags for gradual rollout
- [ ] Contract testing between services

### 7. Failure Handling & Resilience
**Goal**: Build systems that degrade gracefully

**Chaos Engineering Tasks**:
- [ ] Random service failures
- [ ] Network partition simulation
- [ ] Resource exhaustion testing
- [ ] Cascading failure prevention
- [ ] Recovery time measurement

**Patterns to Implement**:
- Circuit breakers
- Bulkheads
- Timeout handling
- Fallback strategies
- Health check propagation

### 8. Performance & Scalability
**Goal**: Understand distributed system performance characteristics

**Must Measure & Optimize**:
- [ ] Service response time percentiles
- [ ] Event processing throughput
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Cache hit ratios
- [ ] Resource utilization per service

**Load Testing Scenarios**:
- 1000 concurrent users browsing
- 100 orders per second
- Inventory updates under load
- Black Friday traffic simulation

## Learning Checkpoints

### After Each Service
1. What patterns did I implement?
2. What failures did I encounter?
3. How did I debug issues?
4. What would I do differently?
5. What monitoring proved valuable?

### Integration Points
1. How did services discover each other?
2. What coordination challenges arose?
3. How did I handle partial failures?
4. What data consistency issues appeared?

### Production Readiness
1. Can I debug a stuck order?
2. Can I deploy without downtime?
3. Can I handle 10x traffic?
4. Can I recover from database failure?
5. Can I track business metrics?

## Anti-Patterns to Experience (and Fix)

1. **Distributed Monolith**: Services too tightly coupled
2. **Chatty Services**: Too many synchronous calls
3. **Shared Database**: Breaking service boundaries
4. **Big Ball of Mud**: Unclear service boundaries
5. **Death Star**: Complex service dependency graph

## Success Metrics

- Can explain why microservices added complexity
- Can debug issues across 4+ services
- Has implemented 5+ distributed patterns
- Can demonstrate system resilience
- Understands CAP theorem trade-offs in practice
- Has production-grade monitoring
- Can handle partial failures gracefully

## Resume-Worthy Achievements

- "Implemented saga pattern reducing failed transactions by 95%"
- "Built event-driven system processing 10K events/minute"
- "Achieved 99.9% uptime with chaos engineering validation"
