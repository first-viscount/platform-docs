## Identified Risks

### RISK-001: Distributed Transaction Complexity
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: High (70%)  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Level**: Critical

**Description**: Implementing distributed transactions across microservices may lead to data inconsistency and complex failure scenarios.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Implement Saga pattern with clear compensation logic
2. Use event sourcing for audit trail
3. Design for eventual consistency
4. Create comprehensive integration tests
5. Document all failure scenarios

**Contingency Plan**: Fall back to synchronous API calls with circuit breakers if event-driven approach proves too complex.

### RISK-002: Multi-Repository Coordination Overhead
**Category**: Process  
**Probability**: High (80%)  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Level**: High

**Description**: Coordinating changes across multiple repositories will slow development and increase integration issues.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Strict API versioning from day one
2. Automated contract testing
3. Feature flags for gradual rollout
4. Comprehensive documentation
5. Clear ownership boundaries

**Contingency Plan**: Consider mono-repo with clear module boundaries if coordination becomes unmanageable.

---

### RISK-003: Learning Curve for Distributed Systems
**Category**: Knowledge  
**Probability**: Medium (50%)  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**: Complexity of microservices may overwhelm learning capacity and slow progress.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Build one service completely before next
2. Start with synchronous calls, add async later
3. Extensive documentation of learnings
4. Regular architecture reviews
5. Pair programming for complex parts

**Contingency Plan**: Simplify architecture by combining related services if complexity becomes blocking.

---

### RISK-004: Local Development Environment Complexity
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: High (70%)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**: Running 4+ services locally may exceed developer machine capabilities.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Optimize Docker images for size
2. Use Docker Compose profiles
3. Create "minimal" development mode
4. Document hardware requirements
5. Consider cloud development environments

**Contingency Plan**: Provide shared development server or use cloud-based development environments.

---

### RISK-005: Event Ordering and Duplication
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: Medium (60%)  
**Impact**: High  
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**: Distributed events may arrive out of order or be duplicated, causing data inconsistency.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Use partition keys for ordering
2. Implement idempotent handlers
3. Add event deduplication
4. Include sequence numbers
5. Design for out-of-order events

**Contingency Plan**: Implement synchronous fallback for critical operations.

---

### RISK-006: Service Discovery Failures
**Category**: Technical  
**Probability**: Low (30%)  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**: Platform Coordination service failure could break all inter-service communication.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Cache service discovery data
2. Implement health check bypasses
3. Use DNS as fallback
4. Deploy Platform Coordination with HA
5. Circuit breakers on all calls

**Contingency Plan**: Hard-code service addresses in configuration as emergency fallback.

---

### RISK-007: Performance Degradation
**Category**: Performance  
**Probability**: Medium (50%)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**: Network calls between services may cause unacceptable latency.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Implement caching aggressively
2. Use batch APIs where possible
3. Optimize database queries
4. Monitor performance from day one
5. Set clear SLA targets

**Contingency Plan**: Combine chatty services or implement read-through caches.

---

### RISK-008: Debugging Complexity
**Category**: Operational  
**Probability**: High (90%)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Risk Level**: High

**Description**: Tracing issues across multiple services will be extremely difficult.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Implement distributed tracing early
2. Use correlation IDs everywhere
3. Centralized logging with structure
4. Comprehensive monitoring dashboards
5. Practice debugging scenarios

**Contingency Plan**: Implement synchronous "debug mode" for easier troubleshooting.

---

### RISK-009: Security Vulnerabilities
**Category**: Security  
**Probability**: Medium (40%)  
**Impact**: Critical  
**Risk Level**: High

**Description**: Multiple service endpoints increase attack surface.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Implement OAuth2/JWT from start
2. Use mTLS for service communication
3. Regular security audits
4. Automated vulnerability scanning
5. Principle of least privilege

**Contingency Plan**: Implement API Gateway as single entry point with strict controls.

---

### RISK-010: Scope Creep
**Category**: Project  
**Probability**: High (70%)  
**Impact**: Medium  
**Risk Level**: Medium

**Description**: Adding features before core platform is stable.

**Mitigation Strategies**:
1. Strict MVP definition
2. Feature freeze during Phase 1
3. Regular scope reviews
4. Clear success criteria
5. Stakeholder alignment

**Contingency Plan**: Postpone additional features to Phase 2.
